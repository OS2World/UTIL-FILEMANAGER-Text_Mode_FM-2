Building FMT                               			02 Apr 2003
============

FMT is the FM/2 Tiny Textmode file manager, for use on those occasions when 
you have to boot to a text-only OS/2 command prompt.  Its footprint (size and 
memory usage) is very small, so it can easily be run from diskette.  
Multi-file operations are multithreaded, so you don't have to wait on the 
program while it's doing work that may take considerable time.  FMT is page 
tuned, which means it uses even less memory and loads even faster than just 
looking at the size of the program might lead you to believe.
