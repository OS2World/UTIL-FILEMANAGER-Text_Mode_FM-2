  Alt+X    = eXit program                   Ctrl+D = Delete marked files
  Escape   = back one directory level       TAB    = command line

About default actions:
=====================
The default action (what happens when you press the Return key) depends
on what the current file object is.  If the highlighted object is a
directory, it's the same as pressing the right arrow -- you move into
that directory.  If it's an executable file (including batch files), the
file is executed.  Otherwise, the file is viewed.  FMT has a simple
internal viewer, but you can plug in your own using FMT.CFG (press
Shift+F2 to create an FMT.CFG that you can then edit -- note that FMT
reads this configuration file only on startup).  Press Shift+F4 to set a
new viewer while FMT is running.  Don't forget to press Shift+F2 if you
want to save it, unless you have AUTOSAVECFG in FMT.CFG.

About target directory:
======================
When FMT copies or moves files, it does so from the current directory
(the one which holds the files you're looking at in the main window) to
the target directory (listed on the second-to-last line of the screen).
The target directory can be set by pressing Ctrl+F1, which makes the
current directory the new target directory.  You can also swap the
current and target directories with Shift+F1.  Finally, you can type in
the pathname of a new target directory using Alt+T (it'll be created if
it doesn't already exist).  You can enter a default target directory
into FMT.CFG if you like.

About saved directories:
=======================
You can save eleven directories for instant recall.  You save the
current directory to one of the slots using Ctrl+F2 through Ctrl+F12.
You recall one of those saved directories by using Alt+F2 through
Alt+F12.  Alt+F1 can be used to list the currently saved directories to
refresh your memory.  You can enter directories into FMT.CFG so that
they'll be loaded each time you start FMT, if you like.

About editing files:
===================
FMT has no internal editor.  By default, it will use T2.EXE (T/2 by Tim
Baldwin, which comes with OS/2), but you can enter an editor to be used
in its place into FMT.CFG if you like.  Press Shift+F5 to set a new
editor while FMT is running.

About editing text:
==================
When entering text into FMT, F1 inserts the current directory name, F2
inserts the current filename, F4 inserts the current target name, Ctrl+Y
clears the current input, Tab attempts to complete the last word at the
cursor position by matching a filename, and other arrow/etc. keys behave
as might be expected.  The entry area is scrollable, if the input can
exceed the width of your screen. If you are entering text to be found in
a file in the viewer, you can use C-like escape codes (i.e. \r for a
carriage return, \x1b for an Escape character).  Note that this means
that a plain backslash (\) must be entered as two backslashes (\\).  If
you are entering a filter (Alt+F) or command line (TAB or F9), the up
and down arrows cycle through up to the last 25 entries.

About confirmations:
===================
When asked to confirm an action (for example, "Copy 3 marked files?"),
respond with either "Y" or the Return key to answer in the affirmative,
and either "N" or the Escape key to answer in the negative.  Actions
copy, move and delete are confirmed by FMT.  Copy and move confirmations
are followed by a question asking if you want to overwrite any existing
files.  You are informed if any existing files were detected, but you
are always asked, since many background threads can be running
simultaneously and could result in conflicts occuring after the process
has begun.  F3 at this second confirmation will abort the command, since
Escape means "no, don't overwrite."

About marking files:
===================
The copy, move, delete, print and touch commands operate on marked
files, if any are marked -- otherwise they operate on the current file.
All other commands that work on selections from the file object listing
area always work on the current (inverse highlighted) file. There are a
variety of ways to mark files -- the simplest is to press the spacebar
to mark or unmark the current file.  Marked file objects are displayed
in a different color than their unmarked counterparts.  I suppose this
is a good time to mention that files and directories are displayed in
different colors, too, so you can easily tell the difference at a
glance.  Note that the '/' command will mark only files if the current
file object is a file, or only directories if the current file object
is a directory.

About matching files via keyboard input:
=======================================
When you type a key that's not a command, FMT tries to find a matching
filename in the file listing area.  You can type as many characters as
you like, and FMT will try to find a name starting with those
characters.  During this process, FMT shows you what you've typed so far
on the line that usually shows the target directory.  There's a timer on
this, so the input will disappear after a couple of seconds with no
further input.  You can edit what you've typed using the backspace key
to delete the last character, or Ctrl+Y to clear the input entirely. You
can enter any command you like, including keys that scroll through the
list, during this time without having to clear the input first -- that's
done automatically for you.  EXCEPTIONS:  The spacebar enters a space
rather than marking a file, the backslash (\) key enters a backslash
rather than switching to the root directory while this find is in
progress, and the Escape key will clear the input.  Try it, it's simpler
to see than to explain.

About editing file object attributes:
====================================
In this "dialog," use the spacebar to toggle attributes from off (-) to
on (x) and vice versa.  Use the up and down arrows to move the cursor.
Press the Return key to accept the changes, or Escape to abort.

About refreshing:
================
FMT does the work for potentially slow operations in background threads.  
This means you can go on to the next task while FMT is still working on the 
last task.  However, it also means that the screen display might not match 
actual disk content.  For example, after a file is deleted, it will still 
appear on the display.

When you need to be sure that the display is synchonized with the disk, just 
press the F2 key.

About finding files:
===================
Use FMT's Alt+S (Show all files in all subdirectories) to find any file
on any subdirectory of a drive.  Switch to the root directory (\), type
the name of the file desired as the filter (Alt+F), then press Alt+S.
Other uses for this feature are left to the user's imagination -- you'll
undoubtedly think of some I didn't.  You can do the same thing on more
than one drive using Alt+Z.

Warning about Alt+Z and Alt+S:
=============================
Since you're going to be running FMT when you boot from diskettes, you
won't have a swap file.  These commands can consume a lot of memory,
depending on how many files you have.  Be careful.  FMT may not display
all matching files if it runs out of memory.  Use of a filter to pare
the number of files in the file object listing area may help a lot.

About Scroll Lock:
=================
If Scroll Lock is on, FMT will START programs.  If it is off, it will
run them through the default OS/2 shell.

FMT.CFG hint:
============
Make one with Shift+F2 and look at it with a text editor.  There are
some things documented in there that aren't in here.

Description of main window:

Below is a labelled diagram of the main FMT window (the one you see when
FMT starts up).

The number of files and bytes are those displayed in the file object
listing area, with filtering applied -- actual total size of the
directory may vary from what's shown, if you're excluding anything.  An
"F" appears at the bottom right corner of the screen when you are
filtering.  As in FM/2, you can use multiple filters separated by
semi-colons.

Sizes displayed in the file object listing area reflect a combination of
file and EA sizes.  The status areas at the top of the window show the
sizes for the current file object broken out into file size and EA size.

When background threads are doing work, messages from them appear on the
bottom line of the screen.  You can abort further action by a background
thread by exiting the program (F3 -- Alt+X will prompt you before
exiting if background threads are active).  When this line is not in use
by background threads, it displays quick function key help.
